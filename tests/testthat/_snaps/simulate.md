# simulate errors if distribution-free variables are not fixed

    the target <greta_array>s are related to variables that do not have distributions so cannot be sampled

# simulate errors if a distribution cannot be sampled from

    sampling is not yet implemented for "hypergeometric" distributions

# simulate errors nicely if nsim is invalid
