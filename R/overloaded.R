#' @title Functions overloaded by greta
#'
#' @description greta provides a wide range of methods to apply common R
#'   functions and operations to \code{greta_array} objects. A few of these
#'   functions and operators are not associated with a class system, so they are
#'   overloaded here. This should not affect normal use of these functions, but
#'   they need to be documented to satisfy CRAN's check.

#'   x,y,nrow,ncol,MARGIN,STATS,FUN,check.margin,\dots,r,k,upper.tri,transpose,l,na.rm,dims
#'    arguments as in original documentation
