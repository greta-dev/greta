# Introduction

This model appears in chapter 14 of
[Gelman and Hill](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm), which is a
discussion state-level voting outcomes. Individual responses (`y`) are labelled
as 1 for supporters of the Republican candidate and 0 for supporters of the
Democrat (with undecideds excluded).

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(bayesplot)
library(future)
library(greta)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

```{r}
packageVersion("greta")
```

To access this data, we'll directly source a script from the `stan-dev` GitHub
repo. See the
[README](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/blob/master/ARM/Ch.14/README)
file for more information on the contents of the script.

```{r}
root <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stan-dev/example-models/master"
model_data <- "ARM/Ch.14/election88_full.data.R"
source(file.path(root, model_data))
ls()
```

Using this data, we will look to answer the following: **what effect did race
and gender have on voting outcomes in the 1988 election**. While we cannot
answer this question in causal terms without experimental data, we can at least
answer this data in observational terms.

We'll implement a multi-level model with varying intercepts. In `lme4` syntax,
that's

```
glmer(y ~ black + female + (1 | state), family = binomial(link = "logit"))
```

Where `black` identifies whether or not the respondent is black. 1 for 'yes' and
0 for 'no'. `female` is a similar flag: 1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no'. State is
numerically encoded values, equivalent to the data component of a factor
variable.

The equivalent Stan model is

```
data {
  int<lower=0> N; 
  int<lower=0> n_state; 
  vector<lower=0,upper=1>[N] black;
  vector<lower=0,upper=1>[N] female;
  int<lower=1,upper=n_state> state[N];
  int<lower=0,upper=1> y[N];
} 
parameters {
  vector[n_state] a;
  vector[2] b;
  real<lower=0,upper=100> sigma_a;
  real mu_a;
}
transformed parameters {
  vector[N] y_hat;

  for (i in 1:N)
    y_hat[i] = b[1] * black[i] + b[2] * female[i] + a[state[i]];
} 
model {
  mu_a ~ normal(0, 1);
  a ~ normal (mu_a, sigma_a);
  b ~ normal (0, 100);
  y ~ bernoulli_logit(y_hat);
}
```

# Exploring the data

To begin, we'll plot values for each of the values that we'll be working
with.

The target (voting outcome):

```{r}
data.frame(y) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of voting outcomes")
```

Here's the gender indicator.

```{r}
data.frame(female) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(female)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of female indicator")
```

Here's the race indicator.

```{r}
data.frame(black) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(black)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of black indicator")
```

Here's the state variable. We have 51 state codes in the data, which includes
Washington, DC.

```{r}
data.frame(state) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(state)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of values within state")
```

On the other, there are no observations for states 2 or 12. We'll drop them
from the model.

```{r}
state_recoded <- dplyr::dense_rank(state)
table(state_recoded)
```


# Building the model

Switching into  `greta`, we'll start by defining the data objects to use in our
model.

```{r}
n <- length(y)
n_states <- max(state_recoded)

y_greta <- as_data(y)
black_greta <- as_data(black)
female_greta <- as_data(female)
state_greta <- as_data(state_recoded)
```

Now, we'll set up the model components. First, the random effects. To match the
Stan code above, we'll store all of these in an `a` vector. We specify the
number of effects using the `dim` parameter below.

```{r}
mu_a <- normal(0, 1)
sigma_a <- variable(lower = 0.0, upper = 100.0)
a <- normal(mu_a, sigma_a, dim = n_states)
```

We can use a similar approach to get the fixed effects in a single vector. We'll
have two effects.

```{r}
b <- normal(0, 100, dim = 2)
```

We will define the distribution of the outcome variable, `y`, as a
transformation of a linear combination of the inputs above.

```{r}
y_hat <- b[1] * black_greta + b[2] * female_greta + a[state_recoded]
p <- ilogit(y_hat)
distribution(y_greta) <- binomial(n, p)
```

And finally, we assemble the components that we wish to sample in a model.

```{r}
e88_model <- model(b, a, precision = "double")
```

Let's check out our graph.

```{r}
plot(e88_model)
```

# Inference

Model in hand, we can begin sampling. Since we are sampling across multiple
chains, we'll use the "multisession" future strategy to do everything in
parallel.

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE}
draws <- mcmc(e88_model, warmup = 1000, n_samples = 1000, chains = 4)
```

Time to diagnose. Did the sample chains for our fixed effects mix reasonably?
For all of the following visualizations, we'll rely on the `bayesplot` package.

```{r}
bayesplot::mcmc_trace(draws, regex_pars = "b\\[[.[12]")
```

And what about the random effects? We'll investigate the first 5. Remember,
we've recoded the previous state vector to remove the levels 2 and 12, which
didn't have any observations.

```{r}
bayesplot::mcmc_trace(draws, regex_pars = "a\\[[1-5]\\,")
```

Understanding our coefficients in their current form is a little hard, since
they are on the logit scale. It would be nicer to work with probabilities. We
can use `calculate` for this step.

To get every transformed version of our model parameters, we pass the `draws`
object as the second argument. To get the name in an expected manner, we
will assign the transformation to a local variable first.

```{r}
prob <- ilogit(b)
as_probs <- calculate(prob, values = draws)
```

And now a plot.

```{r}
mcmc_areas(as_probs)
```

And the summarized results.

```{r}
summary(as_probs)
```

# Wrapping up

We can finally go back to the question posed at this beginning of this example.
During the 1988 election a black voter, from a randomly selected state, had
a .25 to .27 probability of voting for Reagan, while women had .48 to .49
probability of voting for the Republican candidate.
